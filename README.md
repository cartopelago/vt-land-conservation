## Vermont Land Conservation Docs  

This is a collection of methods for planning land conservation and restoration using [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and [Whitebox](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbt_book/intro.html). My goal is to develop methods for conservation planning in the Town of Middlebury and then aim to extend the methods to Addison County and other fragmented New England landscapes.     

### Tree Habitat Blocks  

[_treeHabitatBlocks.py][thb] identifies contiguous regions of tree canopy with conservation values due to their size, representation of rare and wetland communities, and/or age.
