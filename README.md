## Vermont Land Conservation Docs  

This is a collection of methods for planning land conservation and restoration. I used [Whitebox](https://www.whiteboxgeo.com/manual/wbt_book/intro.html) for raster analysis [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) for data prep.  

#### Methods     

[treeHabitatBlocks.py][thb] identifies contiguous regions of tree canopy with conservation values due to their size, representation of rare and wetland communities, and/or age.
